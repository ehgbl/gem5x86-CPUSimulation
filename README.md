Created a Python simulation script using the gem5 computer architecture simulator. Built a simple system with an x86 CPU core, DRAM memory subsystem, and memory controller connected via a system bus. Configured CPU parameters (clock speed, cache sizes), memory specifications (capacity, latency), and bus characteristics. Ran workloads to analyze performance metrics like cache hit rates, memory bandwidth utilization, and instruction throughput.
